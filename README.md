Data and python notebooks for polling and results of 2019 election. Feel free to fork, I'm not really sure what to put down for licensing, its all public domain data. References for sources will be added as needed.

There is no guarantee for the veracity of the data here and it is not expression of opinion of anybody I am accociated with or work for. It is intended as an interesting collection of data for plotting and drawing out trends.

Initial data for opinion polling was drawn from Wikipedia summary [Opinion polling for the 2019 Australian federal election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_2019_Australian_federal_election). There is an extensive list of references of primary sources listed there for all the polls.  

## Betting odds
If anybody has a source of betting odds as a function of time that would make an awesome addition.  At this stage I have missed the boat on collecting data directly for the 2019 election and building a bot to trawl the betting websites is too much work right now.
